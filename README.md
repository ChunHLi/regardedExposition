#Quoogle: because it's not bing

##Goals:
* *Create a slower, worse version of google but a better version of bing in one week's time*

##Collaborators
* *[Shawn Li](https://github.com/TyranitarShawn)*
* *[Albert Mokrejs](https://github.com/AlbertMokrejs)*

##To-do List:
* Front End:
  - Make 'Quoogle' Logo.
  - Make 'Quoogle' Favicon.
  - Add forms.
  - Add about page.

* Middleware:
  - Figure out what "Middleware" is.
  - Hire someone to make Middleware.

* Back End:
  - Figure out how to determine a "right" date rather than just a correct date.
  - Figure out how not to get multiple nouns rather than names.
  - Make the code readable.
  - Remove redundant code.

##Odd Bugs:
  - Newspaper names are more popular than legit names.
  - Timestamps on website comments ruin dates.
  - Christmas is evidently only on 2014-12-23
